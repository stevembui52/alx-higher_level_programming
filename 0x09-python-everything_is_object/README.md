# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

## Description
Repository to study the following Python topics: Now that we understand that everything is an object and have a little bit of knowledge, lets pause and look a little bit closer at how Python works with different types of objects.

- What is an object
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
- What is a reference
- What is an assignment
- What is an alias
- How to know if two variables are identical
- How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
- How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
- What is mutable and immutable
- What are the built-in mutable types
- What are the built-in immutable types
- How does Python pass variables to functions

Task Name|Task Description
---|---
0 - Who am I?|What function would you use to print the type of an object?
1 - Where are you?|How do you get the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)?
2 - Right count |point to the same object
3 - Right count =|yes point to the same object
4 - Right count =|Yes point to the same object
5 - Right count =+|No point
6 - Is equal|Print True ==
7 - Is the same|Print True 'is'
8 - Is really equal|Print True ==
9 -  Is really the same|Print True 'is'
10 - And with a list, is it equal|== True list [] focus in content of list
11 - answer.txt|is False in list. Focus in point of list
12 - And with a list, is it really equal|True == alias in Python
13 - answer.txt|True with is because used alias in list l2 = l1 
14 - List append|used .append and alias with lists
15 - List add|add value into the list is different 
16 - Integer incrementation|increments work 
17 - List incrementation|change content of list with .append
18 - List assignation|assing values after def 
19 - Copy a list object|returns a copy of a list.
20 - Tuple or not?|yes tuple
21 - Tuple or not?|yes tuple
22 - Tuple or not?|no tuple
23 - Tuple or not?|yes tuple
24 - Richard Sim's special #0|True integers a = (1)
25 - Richard Sim's special #1|False diffents tuples with 'is'
26 - Richard Sim's special #2|True tuples emptys
27 - Richard Sim's special #3|No, change
28 - Richard Sim's special #4|Yes, don't change
29 - Python3: Mutable, Immutable... everything is object!|link here
35 - Clear strings|How many string objects are created by the execution of the first line of the script? (106-line1.txt)
How many string objects are created by the execution of the second line of the script (106-line2.txt)
After the execution of line 3, is the string object pointed by a deleted? Answer with Yes or No (106-line3.txt)
After the execution of line 4, is the string object pointed by b deleted? Answer with Yes or No (106-line4.txt)
How many string objects are created by the execution of the last line of the script (106-line5.txt)
